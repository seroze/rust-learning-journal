Will use this repo to track the new things iam learning in rust 

Current focus is to implement some data structures in rust I'm using metame's rust-dsa project for reference https://github.com/metame/rust-dsa/tree/main 


Some Philosophy: 

- Context switching is fine but you have to reach some checkpoint before switching to the other one. 
- don't give up on concepts, think deeply about them and note them down, If you try 100 things but if you don't explore them deep enough then you haven't gained anything
- don't say excuses have that inbuilt sense of urgency
